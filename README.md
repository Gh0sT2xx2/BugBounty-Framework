# Bug Bounty Framework

## Description

The **Bug Bounty Framework** simulates a terminal-based environment to help users experience a virtual file system and find bug bounty tools. It includes useful commands combined with animated effects like binary rain, Matrix effects, and cyber grids to make the experience more engaging.

---

## Features

- **Terminal-Like Interface**: Fully interactive terminal simulation that lets you execute commands as if you were on a real system.
- **File System Navigation**: Navigate through directories and files in a virtual environment.
- **Search Functionality**: Use the `find -name "pattern"` command to search for files and directories matching a pattern.
- **Commands**: 
  - `ls`: List contents of the current directory.
  - `cd [directory]`: Change the current directory.
  - `cat [file]`: View file contents.
  - `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
  - `find -name "pattern"`: Search for files matching a pattern (supports wildcards like `*`).
  - `help`: Show available commands.
  - `clear`: Clear the terminal screen.
- **Interactive Features**:
  - **Command History**: Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through previously entered commands.
  - **Tab Completion**: Automatically complete commands and paths by pressing `Tab`.
  - **Clickable Links**: Open URLs directly in a new browser tab.
- **Dynamic Animations**:
  - **Binary Rain**: Display falling binary numbers on the screen.
  - **Matrix Effect**: Simulate the iconic Matrix rain of characters.
  - **Cyber Grid**: Display animated gridlines and data nodes.

## Usage

To start using the framework, simply add the provided script to your project, and it will initialize a terminal interface where you can start executing commands.

### Example Usage

1. Once initialized, you'll see a prompt. You can begin by listing the contents of the current directory with the `ls` command:
   ```bash
   root@bugbounty:/home/bughunter$ ls
   subdomain-enumeration/  vulnerability-analysis/
   ```

2. Navigate into directories using `cd` and list files:
   ```bash
   root@bugbounty:/home/bughunter$ cd subdomain-enumeration
   root@bugbounty:/home/bughunter/subdomain-enumeration$ ls
   tools/
   ```

3. View file contents with `cat`:
   ```bash
   root@bugbounty:/home/bughunter/subdomain-enumeration/tools$ cat subdomain_scanner.txt
   # <hyperlink>...
   ```

4. Use `pwd` to print the current directory:
   ```bash
   root@bugbounty:/home/bughunter/subdomain-enumeration/tools$ pwd
   /home/bughunter/subdomain-enumeration/tools
   ```

5. Use `find -name` to search for files:
   ```bash
   root@bugbounty:/home/bughunter$ find -name "scanner"
   tools/subdomain_scanner.txt
   ```

6. Type `help` to view available commands:
   ```bash
   root@bugbounty:/home/bughunter$ help
   ```

## Ethical Considerations

While this framework provides a simulated environment for learning and exploration, itâ€™s crucial to always consider ethical guidelines when working in real-world environments, especially in the field of cybersecurity.

- **Respect for Privacy**: Always ensure that any security testing is conducted on systems for which you have explicit authorization. Never perform activities like penetration testing or subdomain enumeration on systems without the owner's permission.
- **Legal Compliance**: Make sure you adhere to all local, regional, and global laws and regulations when conducting security research or bug hunting.
- **Responsible Disclosure**: If you discover a vulnerability in a bug bounty program, make sure to follow the responsible disclosure process. Share the details with the program owner and provide them an opportunity to fix the issue before making any public disclosure.
